# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) - Complete Guide

## 1️⃣ What is CORS?

**CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**

It is a browser security mechanism that controls which websites are allowed to access resources from another website.

## 2️⃣ What is an "origin"?

An origin = protocol + domain + port

**Examples:**

- `https://example.com` → one origin
- `http://example.com` → different origin (different protocol)
- `https://api.example.com` → different origin (different domain)
- `https://example.com:3000` → different origin (different port)

If any one part differs, it's a cross-origin request.

## 3️⃣ The core problem (why CORS exists)

**Imagine this situation:**

- You are logged into your bank website
- Your browser has cookies / session tokens
- You open a malicious website in another tab

**Without protection:** 👉 That malicious site could secretly send requests to your bank using your login session and steal data.

**This is very dangerous!**

## 4️⃣ Then why do we need CORS?

Modern apps must communicate across origins.

**Examples:**

- Frontend: `https://myapp.com`
- Backend API: `https://api.myapp.com`
- Third-party APIs (maps, payments, auth)

**Without CORS:**

- ❌ Browser blocks responses
- ❌ Modern web apps break

So we need a controlled exception to Same-Origin Policy.

👉 **That controlled exception is CORS.**

## 5️⃣ How CORS works (simple flow)

### Step 1: Browser sends a request with an Origin header

```http
Origin: https://myapp.com
```

### Step 2: Server replies with headers like

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com
```

### Step 3: Browser checks

- If allowed → response is accessible ✅
- If not allowed → response is blocked ❌

**Server decides. Browser enforces.**


## 1️⃣ What does `import path from "path";` mean?

It means you are importing Node.js's built-in `path` module so you can work with file and directory paths safely.

### What is `path`?

`path` is a core Node.js module (no installation needed) that helps you:

- Join paths correctly
- Resolve absolute paths
- Handle OS differences (Windows vs Linux/Mac)
- Avoid hard-coding `/` or `\`

### Why do we need `path`?

File paths are OS-dependent:

- **Windows** → `C:\users\file.txt`
- **Linux / macOS** → `/home/users/file.txt`

If you hardcode paths, your app may break on another OS.

👉 **`path` handles this automatically.**

## 2️⃣ What is `cookie-parser`? (Simple + practical)

`cookie-parser` is a middleware for Express.js that reads cookies sent by the browser and makes them easy to access in your server code.

### Why cookies need parsing

When a browser sends cookies, they arrive as a raw string in the HTTP header:

```http
Cookie: token=abc123; theme=dark; loggedIn=true
```

This format is not convenient to use directly.

👉 **`cookie-parser` parses this string and converts it into a clean JavaScript object.**

### What `cookie-parser` does

After using it, you get:

```javascript
req.cookies = {
  token: "abc123",
  theme: "dark",
  loggedIn: "true"
}
```

So you can easily write:

```javascript
req.cookies.token
```

## 3️⃣ `server.listen()` / `app.listen()` — Start the server

### What it means

This starts your backend and tells it:

**"Listen for incoming requests on this port."**

### Important clarification

⚠️ **`listen()` does not handle requests**

It only opens the door.

**Routes + middleware handle the requests.**

---

## 4️⃣ `dotenv.config()` — Load environment variables

### The problem it solves

You should **never hardcode secrets** like:

- Database passwords
- API keys
- JWT secrets

Instead, you keep them in a `.env` file.

### Example `.env`

```env
PORT=5000
DB_URL=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=xyz123
```

### What `dotenv.config()` does

```javascript
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();
```

It:

1. Reads the `.env` file
2. Loads variables into `process.env`

So you can use:

```javascript
process.env.PORT
process.env.DB_URL
process.env.JWT_SECRET
```

### ⚠️ Very important rule

**`dotenv.config()` must run before you access `process.env`**

---

## 5️⃣ `app.use(express.json());`

### What it does

Without this, the server **cannot read data sent by the client** which is in JSON format.

All info comes in `req.body`.

### Example

```javascript
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/user', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { name: "John", age: 25 }
});
```

👉 **This middleware parses JSON from the request body and makes it accessible via `req.body`**

---

## 6️⃣ Why do we use `app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes);`?

It tells Express.js:

**"For every request that starts with `/api/auth`, forward it to `authRoutes`."**

### How it works

| Route file  | Actual API URL       |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `/login`    | `/api/auth/login`    |
| `/register` | `/api/auth/register` |

### Key benefit

You don't repeat `/api/auth` inside every route.

**Example:**

```javascript
// authRoutes.js
router.post('/login', ...);      // Becomes /api/auth/login
router.post('/register', ...);   // Becomes /api/auth/register

// app.js
app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes);
```

## 7️⃣ Why `const __dirname = path.resolve();` is used

### Short answer

👉 In **ES Modules**, `__dirname` does not exist by default, so `path.resolve()` is used to recreate the project's root directory path.

### What `path.resolve()` does

```javascript
path.resolve()
```

- Returns the **absolute path** of the current working directory
- Usually the **root of your project**
- Based on where `node` was started

**Example output:**

```
/Users/priyansh/projects/myapp
```

### Why people write this line

```javascript
const __dirname = path.resolve();
```

They are:

- Creating a variable named `__dirname`
- Assigning it the project root path
- So existing Express code keeps working

### When is this needed?

**CommonJS (old way):**

```javascript
// __dirname is available automatically
console.log(__dirname);
```

**ES Modules (new way):**

```javascript
// __dirname does NOT exist
// So we recreate it:
import path from "path";
const __dirname = path.resolve();
```

### Common use case

```javascript
import path from "path";
const __dirname = path.resolve();

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

// Load environment variables
dotenv.config({ path: path.join(__dirname, ".env") });
```

👉 **This ensures your paths work correctly regardless of where you run `node` from.**
